# Deployment: Simple Deployment

## Goal
Learn about rolling updates and why this is cool on Kubernetes.

1. First let's deploy something.

```
kubectl apply -f 14_deployment_rolling_update_replicaset.yaml
```

This will deploy a nginx server with 3 replica's and a load balancer.  

2. Find the address of the load balancer service.

```
kubectl get svc
```

3. Go to the load balancer url / ip.

We have to update and expand.

4. Cleanup

```
kubectl delete -f 1-deployment_rolling_update_replicaset.yaml
```
