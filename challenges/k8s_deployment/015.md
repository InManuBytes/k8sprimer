# Deployment: Rolling Updates

1. Before we update, lets just do a quick run to see how we can easily expand our pods. We have 3 pods running, so lets make this 6 and see how fast this happens.

```
kubectl get pod
```
2. Let's apply our updated image with more replicas.

```
kubectl apply -f 15_deployment_rolling_update_image.yaml
```

3. We see we have 6 pods, 3 are starting.

```
kubectl get pods
```

4. Now, we are going to update the image of our container across the entire replica set.

```
kubectl rollout status deploy challenge14
```

5. Now, list all services in the namespace to find the load balancer's ip address/url and find the flag using your brower.

6. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2015-8)

7. Cleanup

```
kubectl delete -f 15_deployment_rolling_update_image.yaml
```
