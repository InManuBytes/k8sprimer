# Deployment: Rolling Updates

1. Before we update, lets just do a quick run to see how we can easily expand our pods. We have 3 pods running, so lets make this 6 and see how fast this happens.

```
kubectl get pod
```
2. Let's apply our updated image with more replicas.

```
kubectl apply -f 2-deployment_rolling_update_image.yaml
```

3. We see we have 6 pods, 3 are starting.

```
kubectl get pods
```

4. Now, we are going to update the image of our container across the entire replica set.

```
kubectl rollout status deploy myeasyupdate
```

You should see this.
