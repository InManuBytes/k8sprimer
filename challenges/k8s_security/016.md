# K8S Security: Finding Credentilas in Code

Because Kubernetes is a container orchestration framework, many containers will be running on a cluster. Presumably, for these containers to function, they will need to contain credentials to access other cloud services or cluster services.  

1. Lets deploy the challenge and try to find credentials in the deployment. 

```
kubectl apply -f deployment_starwars_creds.yaml
```

2. Get all pods.

```
kubectl get pods
```
3. Go into a pod.

```
kubectl exec -it [PODNAME] -- bash
```
4. Poke around and find the flag.
```
cat index.js
```
5. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2016-9)

6. Exit.

```
exit
```

7. Cleanup.

```
kubectl delete -f deployment_starwars_creds.yaml
```
