# K8S Security: Finding Credentials in Code

Because Kubernetes is a container orchestration framework, many containers will be running on a cluster. Presumably, for these containers to function, they will need to contain credentials to access other cloud services or cluster services.  

1. Lets deploy the challenge and try to find credentials in the deployment. 

```
kubectl apply -f 16_deployment_starwars_creds.yaml
```

2. List all pods.

```
kubectl get pods
```
3. Go into a pod.

```
kubectl exec -it challenge16-[POD ID] -- bash
```
4. Using the **ls** and **cat** command, poke around and find the flag.

**Free Hint**: The flag is a MongoDB database password. 

5. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2016-9) **More free hints available**

6. Exit.

```
exit
```

7. Cleanup.

```
kubectl delete -f 16_deployment_starwars_creds.yaml
```
