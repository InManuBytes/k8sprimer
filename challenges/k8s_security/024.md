# K8S Security: Protection Against Cross Container Access

## What is Cilium?

Cilium is open source software for transparently securing the network connectivity between application services deployed using Linux container management platforms like Docker and Kubernetes.

1. Install `hubble-ui.yaml`.

```
kubectl apply -f hubble-ui.yaml
```

2. Test connectivity.

```
kubectl create ns cilium-test
```
```
kubectl apply -n cilium-test -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/v1.8/examples/kubernetes/connectivity-check/connectivity-check.yaml
```
```
kubectl port-forward -n kube-system svc/hubble-ui --address 0.0.0.0 --address :: 12000:80
```

3. Browse to http://localhost:12000.

4. On another tab, go to [Network Policy Editor for Kubernetes.](https://editor.cilium.io/)

We want to create a network policy that disables access from anywhere in the cluster to port 27017,28017.

5. Save your new policy in `networkpolicy.yaml`.

6. Once you have your policy, apply it to the cluster

```
kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml
```

7. Retry accessing the mongodb environment.

8. Go back into the pentest tools pod

```
kubectl exec -it [PODNAME]-- bash
```
Install ping.

```
apt-get update
```
```
apt-get install iputils-ping dnsutils curl iproute2 -y
```
```
curl http://[MONGOIP]:28017/k8ctf/flag/
```

9. The namespace that we are restricting with our policy is the flag. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2024-16)
