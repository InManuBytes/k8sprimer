# K8S Security: Fixing Secrets in Code

Kubernetes has two vehicles for removing sensitive or configuration related material in deployments:

- Config Maps
- Kube Secrets

In this exercise, we will use kube secrets to remove the username / password from the deployment.

1. Deploy the challenge

```
kubectl apply -f 17_deployment_starwars_secrets.yaml
```
2. Get the IP of the service.

```
kubectl get service
```
![service](https://i.postimg.cc/Syd5rDn1/17-service.png)

![error](https://i.postimg.cc/MZzKMsj6/17-error.png)

We see that the database is having an authentication error because our user:password is 'undefined'.

To fix this, with an editor, we need to create a `starwars_secrets.yaml` file so that our deployment can pull the username / password from kube secrets.  We know the username and password from the previous challenge.

_Password: 09CweCYpHc5tOvwS_

3. Create `starwars_secrets.yaml` and add the correct credentials. Remember secrets need to be [base64 encoded](https://www.base64encode.org/).
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mongodbsecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: [base64:username]
  password: [base64:password]
```

4. When you think you have the correct secrets added to `starwars_secrets.yaml`, apply it to the cluster.

```
kubectl apply -f starwars_secrets.yaml
```
5. Restart the deployment.

```
kubectl rollout restart deployment/challenge17
```
6. Wait until all the pods have updated.

```
kubectl get pods
```
7. Get the IP/url of the service to find the flag. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2017-10)

8. Cleanup.

```
kubectl delete -f deployment_starwars_secrets.yaml
```
