# K8S Security: Consume all resources / DoS

First lets get metrics on node performance. It may take a few minutes for this to come up!

1. Lets install a cryptominer on our cluster that will consume most of the resources.

```
kubectl apply -f 25_deployment_benchmark.yaml
```

2. Try to see what the node performance looks like after the cryptominer is installed.

```
kubectl top nodes
```
We can see that our single pod is consuming 100% of our resources.

3. Pull the log of the pod .

```
kubectl logs [POD NAME]
```

4. The flag is the version of the cryptominer. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2025-17)

5. Definitely delete this cryptominer as its chewing up all the resources on our cluster.
```
kubectl delete -f 25_deployment_benchmark.yaml
```
