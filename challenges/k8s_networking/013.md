# Networking: Load Balancer

1. Deploy a load balancer service.

```
kubectl apply -f 13_simple_load_balancer.yaml
```

2.  Ensure all pods are running.

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

3. List services.

```
kubectl get services
```

4. List endpoints.

```
kubectl get endpoints
```

5. Let's look at the services.

```
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

6. Try going to your browser to access the IP or the AWS load balancer service to grab the flag. [Submit the flag](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2013-6)

 ðŸš¨Load Balancers take a few minute to start serving traffic. If an URL doesn't resolve right away, give it a few minutes.ðŸš¨
7. Clean up.

```
kubectl delete -f 13_simple_load_balancer.yaml
```
