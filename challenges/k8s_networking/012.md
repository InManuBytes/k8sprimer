# Networking: NodePort


1. Deploy a node port service.
```
kubectl apply -f 12_simple_nodeport_service.yaml
```
2.  Ensure they are all running.

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

3. Let's look at the services.

```
kubectl get services
```
4. We should be able to access the pods behind this node port, get the list of IP's for each node.

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

5. Go into one of the pods.

You will need the [DEPOYMENT ID] and the [POD ID].

_Do you remember how to list all pods in the namespace?_ [Review _Interact with the kubectl API (Step 8)_ ](/challenges/k8s_setup/008.md) 

```
kubectl exec -it challenge12-deployment-[DEPLOYMENT ID]-[POD ID] -- bash
```

6.  Before we ping we need to install ping.

```
apt-get update
```

```
apt-get install iputils-ping dnsutils curl iproute2 -y
```

7. Try to curl using one of the node port IP addresses to find the flag. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2012-5)

```
curl [NODE IP ADDRESS]:30001
```

8. Exit

```
exit
```

9. Clean up

```
kubectl delete -f 12_simple_nodeport_service.yaml
```
