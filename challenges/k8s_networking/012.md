# Networking: NodePort


1. Deploy a node port service.
```
kubectl apply -f 12_simple_nodeport_service.yaml
```
2.  Ensure they are all running.

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

3. Let's look at the services.

```
kubectl get services
```
4. We should be able to access the pods behind this node port, get the list of IP's for each node.

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

5. Go into one of the containers.

```
kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-d87cb68c6-xb5j6 -- bash
```

6.  Before we ping we need to install ping.

```
apt-get update
```

```
apt-get install iputils-ping dnsutils curl iproute2 -y
```

7. Try to curl using one of the node port IP addresses.

**Hint: what is the nodeport?**

```
curl 192.168.1.201:30001
```

8. Exit

```
exit
```

9. Clean up

```
kubectl delete -f simple_nodeport_service.yaml
```
