# Networking: Cluster IP pinging

## GOAL

The goal of this challenge is to see how flat a Kubernetes network is.

1. Find Node IP addresses - These are the IP addresses
 
```
 kubectl get nodes -o wide 
```
 2. Add a deployment to your cluster with 3 replicas

```
kubectl apply -f 11_simple_deployment.yaml
```

3. Ensure it's running

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

You will see that each pod is in a separate IP space.

4. Validate that the three IP's are coming from the different nodes that have blocks of addresses to give pods.

5. Find Pod CIDR Ranges

```
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.podCIDR}'
```

They should match!

6. We can exec onto the pod to test connectivity.

```
kubectl exec -it challenge11-[DEPLOYMENT ID]-[POD ID]  -- bash
```

7.  Before we ping we need to install ping.

```
apt-get update
```
```
apt-get install iputils-ping dnsutils curl iproute2 -y
```

8.  Lets check our Pods IP

```
ip address
```

This should match one one the IP addresses you saw above (step 3).

9. Ping the two other hosts.  You should be able to ping them without any problems.

10. Access the web servers one of the containers you just pinged to get the flag. [Submit the flag.](https://devslop.ctfd.io/challenges#Challenge%2011-4) **Hint available.**

```
curl [IP ADDRESS]
```
11. Exit

```
exit
```

12. Cleanup

```
kubectl delete -f 11_simple_deployment.yaml
```
