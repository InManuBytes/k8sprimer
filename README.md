# Kubernetes Primer with OWASP DevSlop

Kubernetes Primer with OWASP DevSlop is a hands-on, interactive workshop and mini-CTF that was designed to give you a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of Kubernetes. 
Through a mix of lectures and mini-challenges, youâ€™ll learn how Kubernetes works.  We will hack and break our clusters and then learn how to fix the underlying security issues.
